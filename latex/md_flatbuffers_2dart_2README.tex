This package is used to read and write \href{https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/}{\texttt{ Flat\+Buffers}}.

Most consumers will want to use the \href{https://github.com/google/flatbuffers}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily flatc} -\/ Flat\+Buffer compiler}} binary for your platform. You can download the flatc version matching your dart package version from \href{https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/releases}{\texttt{ Git\+Hub releases}}.

The Flat\+Buffer compiler {\ttfamily flatc} reads a Flat\+Buffers IDL schema and generates Dart code. The generated classes can be used to read or write binary data/files that are interoperable with other languages and platforms supported by Flat\+Buffers, as illustrated in the {\ttfamily example.\+dart} in the examples folder.

For more details and documentation, head over to the official site and read the \href{https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_tutorial.html}{\texttt{ Tutorial}} and how to \href{https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_use_dart.html}{\texttt{ use Flat\+Buffers in Dart}}.
