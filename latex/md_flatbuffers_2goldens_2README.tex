This directory is a repository for the generated files of {\ttfamily flatc}.

We check in the generated code so we can see, during a PR review, how the changes affect the generated output. Its also useful as a reference to point too as how things work across various languages.

These files are {\bfseries{NOT}} intended to be depended on by any code, such as tests or or compiled examples.

\doxysection*{Languages Specifics}

Each language should keep their generated code in their respective directories. However, the parent schemas can, and should, be shared so we have a consistent view of things across languages. These are kept in the {\ttfamily schema/} directory.

Some languages may not support every generation feature, so each language is required to specify the {\ttfamily flatc} arguments individually.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Try to avoid includes and nested directories, preferring it as flat as possible.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Updating}

Just run the {\ttfamily \doxylink{generate__goldens_8py}{generate\+\_\+goldens.\+py}} script and it should generate them all.
