\chapter{Flex\+Buffers}
\hypertarget{flexbuffers}{}\label{flexbuffers}\index{FlexBuffers@{FlexBuffers}}
Flat\+Buffers was designed around schemas, because when you want maximum performance and data consistency, strong typing is helpful.

There are however times when you want to store data that doesn\textquotesingle{}t fit a schema, because you can\textquotesingle{}t know ahead of time what all needs to be stored.

For this, Flat\+Buffers has a dedicated format, called Flex\+Buffers. This is a binary format that can be used in conjunction with Flat\+Buffers (by storing a part of a buffer in Flex\+Buffers format), or also as its own independent serialization format.

While it loses the strong typing, you retain the most unique advantage Flat\+Buffers has over other serialization formats (schema-\/based or not)\+: Flex\+Buffers can also be accessed without parsing / copying / object allocation. This is a huge win in efficiency / memory friendly-\/ness, and allows unique use cases such as mmap-\/ing large amounts of free-\/form data.

Flex\+Buffers\textquotesingle{} design and implementation allows for a very compact encoding, combining automatic pooling of strings with automatic sizing of containers to their smallest possible representation (8/16/32/64 bits). Many values and offsets can be encoded in just 8 bits. While a schema-\/less representation is usually more bulky because of the need to be self-\/descriptive, Flex\+Buffers generates smaller binaries for many cases than regular Flat\+Buffers.

Flex\+Buffers is still slower than regular Flat\+Buffers though, so we recommend to only use it if you need it.

\doxysection*{Usage in C++}

Include the header {\ttfamily \doxylink{flexbuffers_8h}{flexbuffers.\+h}}, which in turn depends on {\ttfamily \doxylink{flatbuffers_8h}{flatbuffers.\+h}} and {\ttfamily \doxylink{util_8h}{util.\+h}}.

To create a buffer\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{flexbuffers::Builder\ fbb;}
\DoxyCodeLine{fbb.Int(13);}
\DoxyCodeLine{fbb.Finish();}

\end{DoxyCode}


You create any value, followed by {\ttfamily Finish}. Unlike Flat\+Buffers which requires the root value to be a table, here any value can be the root, including a lonely int value.

You can now access the {\ttfamily std\+::vector\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}uint8\+\_\+t\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} that contains the encoded value as {\ttfamily fbb.\+Get\+Buffer()}. Write it, send it, or store it in a parent Flat\+Buffer. In this case, the buffer is just 3 bytes in size.

To read this value back, you could just say\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto}\ root\ =\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceflexbuffers_a1f08dbb0395262a8153e0791567b5f38}{flexbuffers::GetRoot}}(my\_buffer);}
\DoxyCodeLine{int64\_t\ \mbox{\hyperlink{gmock-matchers-comparisons__test_8cc_acb559820d9ca11295b4500f179ef6392}{i}}\ =\ root.AsInt64();}

\end{DoxyCode}


Flex\+Buffers stores ints only as big as needed, so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t differentiate between different sizes of ints. You can ask for the 64 bit version, regardless of what you put in. In fact, since you demand to read the root as an int, if you supply a buffer that actually contains a float, or a string with numbers in it, it will convert it for you on the fly as well, or return 0 if it can\textquotesingle{}t. If instead you actually want to know what is inside the buffer before you access it, you can call {\ttfamily root.\+Get\+Type()} or {\ttfamily root.\+Is\+Int()} etc.

Here\textquotesingle{}s a slightly more complex value you could write instead of {\ttfamily fbb.\+Int} above\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{fbb.Map([\&]()\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ fbb.Vector(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}vec"{}},\ [\&]()\ \{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ fbb.Int(-\/100);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ fbb.String(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Fred"{}});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ fbb.IndirectFloat(4.0f);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ fbb.UInt(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}foo"{}},\ 100);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\});}

\end{DoxyCode}


This stores the equivalent of the JSON value {\ttfamily \{ vec\+: \mbox{[} -\/100, "{}\+Fred"{}, 4.\+0 \mbox{]}, foo\+: 100 \}}. The root is a dictionary that has just two key-\/value pairs, with keys {\ttfamily vec} and {\ttfamily foo}. Unlike Flat\+Buffers, it actually has to store these keys in the buffer (which it does only once if you store multiple such objects, by pooling key values), but also unlike Flat\+Buffers it has no restriction on the keys (fields) that you use.

The map constructor uses a C++11 Lambda to group its children, but you can also use more conventional start/end calls if you prefer.

The first value in the map is a vector. You\textquotesingle{}ll notice that unlike Flat\+Buffers, you can use mixed types. There is also a {\ttfamily Typed\+Vector} variant that only allows a single type, and uses a bit less memory.

{\ttfamily Indirect\+Float} is an interesting feature that allows you to store values by offset rather than inline. Though that doesn\textquotesingle{}t make any visible change to the user, the consequence is that large values (especially doubles or 64 bit ints) that occur more than once can be shared (see Reuse\+Value). Another use case is inside of vectors, where the largest element makes up the size of all elements (e.\+g. a single double forces all elements to 64bit), so storing a lot of small integers together with a double is more efficient if the double is indirect.

Accessing it\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto}\ map\ =\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespaceflexbuffers_a1f08dbb0395262a8153e0791567b5f38}{flexbuffers::GetRoot}}(my\_buffer).\mbox{\hyperlink{classflexbuffers_1_1Reference_ab5b812bf56af8f6eab0e97c2089d2347}{AsMap}}();}

\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{auto}\ vec\ =\ map[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}vec"{}}].AsVector();}

\DoxyCodeLine{vec[2].AsString().c\_str();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ "{}"{}\ (This\ still\ works\ though).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec[2].ToString().c\_str();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ "{}4"{}\ (Or\ have\ it\ converted).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{map[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}foo"{}}].AsUInt8();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ 100}}
\DoxyCodeLine{map[\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}unknown"{}}].IsNull();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ true}}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysection*{Usage in Java}

Java implementation follows the C++ one, closely.

For creating the equivalent of the same JSON {\ttfamily \{ vec\+: \mbox{[} -\/100, "{}\+Fred"{}, 4.\+0 \mbox{]}, foo\+: 100 \}}, one could use the following code\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{FlexBuffersBuilder\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}\ =\ \textcolor{keyword}{new}\ FlexBuffersBuilder(ByteBuffer.allocate(512),}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ FlexBuffersBuilder.BUILDER\_FLAG\_SHARE\_KEYS\_AND\_STRINGS);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ smap\ =\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.startMap();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{int}\ svec\ =\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.startVector();}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.putInt(-\/100);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.putString(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Fred"{}});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.putFloat(4.0);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.endVector(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}vec"{}},\ svec,\ \textcolor{keyword}{false},\ \textcolor{keyword}{false});}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.putInt(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}foo"{}},\ 100);}
\DoxyCodeLine{\mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.endMap(\textcolor{keyword}{null},\ smap);}
\DoxyCodeLine{ByteBuffer\ bb\ =\ \mbox{\hyperlink{namespacebuild_ac88b0ec8265b8fb42c15db20ec716d54}{builder}}.finish();}

\end{DoxyCode}


Similarly, to read the data, just\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{FlexBuffers.Map\ map\ =\ FlexBuffers.getRoot(bb).asMap();}
\DoxyCodeLine{map.size();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ 2}}
\DoxyCodeLine{FlexBuffers.Vector\ vec\ =\ map.get(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}vec"{}}).asVector();}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.size();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ 3}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(0).asLong();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ -\/100;}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(1).asString();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ "{}Fred"{};}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(1).asLong();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ 0\ (Number\ parsing\ failed).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(2).asFloat();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ 4.0}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(2).asString().isEmpty();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ true\ (Wrong\ Type).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(2).asString();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ "{}"{}\ (This\ still\ works\ though).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{vec.get(2).toString();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ "{}4.0"{}\ (Or\ have\ it\ converted).}}
\DoxyCodeLine{map.get(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}foo"{}}).asUInt();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ 100}}
\DoxyCodeLine{map.get(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}unknown"{}}).isNull();\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ true}}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysection*{Binary encoding}

A description of how Flex\+Buffers are encoded is in the \doxysectlink{flatbuffers_internals}{internals}{0} document.

\doxysection*{Nesting inside a Flat\+Buffer}

You can mark a field as containing a Flex\+Buffer, e.\+g. \begin{DoxyVerb}a:[ubyte] (flexbuffer);
\end{DoxyVerb}
 A special accessor will be generated that allows you to access the root value directly, e.\+g. {\ttfamily a\+\_\+flexbuffer\+\_\+root().As\+Int64()}.

\doxysection*{Efficiency tips}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Vectors generally are a lot more efficient than maps, so prefer them over maps when possible for small objects. Instead of a map with keys {\ttfamily x}, {\ttfamily y} and {\ttfamily z}, use a vector. Better yet, use a typed vector. Or even better, use a fixed size typed vector.
\item Maps are backwards compatible with vectors, and can be iterated as such. You can iterate either just the values ({\ttfamily map.\+Values()}), or in parallel with the keys vector ({\ttfamily map.\+Keys()}). If you intend to access most or all elements, this is faster than looking up each element by key, since that involves a binary search of the key vector.
\item When possible, don\textquotesingle{}t mix values that require a big bit width (such as double) in a large vector of smaller values, since all elements will take on this width. Use {\ttfamily Indirect\+Double} when this is a possibility. Note that integers automatically use the smallest width possible, i.\+e. if you ask to serialize an int64\+\_\+t whose value is actually small, you will use less bits. Doubles are represented as floats whenever possible losslessly, but this is only possible for few values. Since nested vectors/maps are stored over offsets, they typically don\textquotesingle{}t affect the vector width.
\item To store large arrays of byte data, use a blob. If you\textquotesingle{}d use a typed vector, the bit width of the size field may make it use more space than expected, and may not be compatible with {\ttfamily memcpy}. Similarly, large arrays of (u)int16\+\_\+t may be better off stored as a binary blob if their size could exceed 64k elements. Construction and use are otherwise similar to strings.
