Helper class to hold data needed in creation of a Flat\+Buffer. To serialize data, you typically call one of the {\ttfamily Create\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}()} functions in the generated code, which in turn call a sequence of {\ttfamily Start\+Table}/ {\ttfamily Push\+Element}/{\ttfamily Add\+Element}/{\ttfamily End\+Table}, or the builtin {\ttfamily Create\+String}/ {\ttfamily Create\+Vector} functions. Do this is depth-\/first order to build up a tree to the root. {\ttfamily Finish()} wraps up the buffer ready for transport.
