We encourage community contributions to Flat\+Buffers through pull requests at the main \href{http://github.com/google/flatbuffers}{\texttt{ http\+://github.\+com/google/flatbuffers}} repository.

 \doxysection*{Before you contribute}

Before we can use your contributions, you {\bfseries{must}} sign one of the following license agreements. The agreements are self-\/served at the following links.

Our code review process will automatically check if you have signed the CLA, so don\textquotesingle{}t fret. Though it may be prudent to check before spending a lot of time on contribution.

\doxysubsection*{Individual Contributions}

For individuals, the \mbox{[}\doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google} Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\mbox{]}(\href{https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual?csw=1}{\texttt{ https\+://cla.\+developers.\+google.\+com/about/google-\/individual?csw=1}}) which is self served at the link. The CLA is required since you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code.

\doxysubsection*{Corporate Contributions}

Contributions made by corporations are covered by the \mbox{[}\doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google} Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement\mbox{]}(\href{https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate}{\texttt{ https\+://cla.\+developers.\+google.\+com/about/google-\/corporate}}).

\doxysection*{Code Reviews}

All submissions require a code review via Github Pull Requests.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Please adhere to the \href{https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html}{\texttt{ Google Style Guide}} for the language(s) you are submitting in.
\item Keep PRs small and focused. Its good practice and makes it more likely your PR will be approved.
\item Please add tests if possible.
\item Include descriptive commit messages and context to the change/issues fixed.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

\doxysection*{Documentation}

Flat\+Buffers uses \href{https://www.mkdocs.org/}{\texttt{ Mk\+Docs}} to generate the static documentation pages served at \href{https://flatbuffers.dev}{\texttt{ https\+://flatbuffers.\+dev}}. Specifically, we use the \href{https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/}{\texttt{ Material for Mk\+Docs}} framework.

The documentation source is contained in the main repo under the \href{https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/tree/master/docs}{\texttt{ docs/}} directory. This \href{https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/46cc3d6432da17cca7694777dcce12e49dd48387/.github/workflows/docs.yml\#L6-L11}{\texttt{ automatically}} get built and published when the commit is made.

\doxysubsection*{Local Development}

We encourage contributors to keep the documentation up-\/to-\/date as well, and it is easy to with {\ttfamily Mk\+Docs} local building and serving tools.

First install {\ttfamily mkdocs-\/material} (see \href{https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/}{\texttt{ Installation}} for other ways)


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{pip\ install\ mkdocs-\/material}

\end{DoxyCode}


Then, in the {\ttfamily root} directory of flatbuffers, run


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdocs\ serve\ -\/f\ docs/mkdocs.yml}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will continually watch the repo for changes to the documentation and serve the rendered pages locally.

Submit your documentation changes with your code changes and they will automatically get published when your code is submitted.
