This tutorial provides an example of how to work with Flat\+Buffers in a variety of languages. The following topics will cover all the steps of using Flat\+Buffers in your application.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Writing a Flat\+Buffers schema file ({\ttfamily .fbs}).
\item Using the {\ttfamily flatc} compiler to transform the schema into language-\/specific code.
\item Importing the generated code and libraries into your application.
\item Serializing data into a flatbuffer.
\item Deserializing a flatbuffer.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

!!! note \begin{DoxyVerb}The tutorial is structured to be language agnostic, with language specifics
in code blocks providing more context. Additionally, this tries to cover the
major parts and type system of flatbuffers to give a general overview. It's
not expected to be an exhaustive list of all features, or provide the best
way to do things.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysection*{Flat\+Buffers Schema ({\ttfamily .fbs})}

To start working with Flat\+Buffers, you first need to create a \doxysectlink{md_flatbuffers_2docs_2source_2schema}{schema}{0} file which defines the format of the data structures you wish to serialize. The schema is processed by the {\ttfamily flatc} compiler to generate language-\/specific code that you use in your projects.

The following \href{https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/master/samples/monster.fbs}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily monster.\+fbs}}} schema will be used for this tutorial. This is part of the Flat\+Buffers \href{https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/tree/master/samples}{\texttt{ sample code}} to give complete sample binaries demonstrations.

Flat\+Buffers schema is a \doxylink{classInterface}{Interface} Definition Language (IDL) that has a couple data structures, see the \doxysectlink{md_flatbuffers_2docs_2source_2schema}{schema}{0} documentation for a detail description. Use the inline code annotations to get a brief synopsis of each part of the schema.

\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Flat\+Buffers has support for namespaces to place the generated code into. There is mixed level of support for namespaces (some languages don\textquotesingle{}t have namespaces), but for the C family of languages, it is fully supported.
\item Enums definitions can be defined with the backing numerical type. Implicit numbering is supported, so that {\ttfamily Green} would have a value of 1.
\item A union represents a single value from a set of possible values. Its effectively an enum (to represent the type actually store) and a value, combined into one. In this example, the union is not very useful, since it only has a single type.
\item A struct is a collection of scalar fields with names. It is itself a scalar type, which uses less memory and has faster lookup. However, once a struct is defined, it cannot be changed. Use tables for data structures that can evolve over time.
\item Flat\+Buffers has the standard set of scalar numerical types ({\ttfamily int8}, {\ttfamily int16}, {\ttfamily int32}, {\ttfamily int64}, {\ttfamily uint8}, {\ttfamily uint16}, {\ttfamily uint32}, {\ttfamily uint64}, {\ttfamily float}, {\ttfamily double}), as well as {\ttfamily bool}. Note, scalars are fixed width, {\ttfamily varints} are not supported.
\item Tables are the main data structure for grouping data together. It can evolve by adding and deprecating fields over time, while preserving forward and backwards compatibility.
\item A field that happens to be a {\ttfamily struct}. This means the data of the {\ttfamily Vec3} struct will be serialized inline in the table without any need for offset.
\item Fields can be provided a default value. Default values can be configured to not be serialized at all while still providing the default value while deserializing. However, once set, a default value cannot be changed.
\item A {\ttfamily string} field which points to a serialized string external to the table.
\item A deprecated field that is no longer being used. This is used instead of removing the field outright.
\item A {\ttfamily vector} field that points to a vector of bytes. Like {\ttfamily strings}, the vector data is serialized elsewhere and this field just stores an offset to the vector.
\item Vector of {\ttfamily tables} and {\ttfamily structs} are also possible.
\item A field to a {\ttfamily union} type.
\item The root of the flatbuffer is always a {\ttfamily table}. This indicates the type of {\ttfamily table} the "{}entry"{} point of the flatbuffer will point to.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

!!! bug "{}\+Get Flat\+Buffers schema syntax highlighting"{}

\doxysection*{Compiling Schema to Code ({\ttfamily flatc})}

After a schema file is written, you compile it to code in the languages you wish to work with. This compilation is done by the \doxysectlink{md_flatbuffers_2docs_2source_2flatc}{Flat\+Buffers Compiler}{0} ({\ttfamily flatc}) which is one of the binaries built in the repo.

\doxysubsection*{Building {\ttfamily flatc}}

Flat\+Buffers uses \href{https://cmake.org/}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily cmake}}} to build projects files for your environment.

=== "{}\+Unix"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```sh
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles"
make flatc
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+Windows"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```sh
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022"
msbuild.exe FlatBuffers.sln
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 See the documentation on \doxysectlink{md_flatbuffers_2docs_2source_2building}{building}{0} for more details and other environments. Some languages also include a prebuilt {\ttfamily flatc} via their package manager.

\doxysubsection*{Compiling Schema}

To compile the schema, invoke {\ttfamily flatc} with the schema file and the language flags you wish to generate code for. This compilation will generate files that you include in your application code. These files provide convenient APIs for serializing and deserializing the flatbuffer binary data.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```sh
flatc --cpp monster.fbs
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```sh
flatc --csharp monster.fbs
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 !!! tip \begin{DoxyVerb}You can deserialize flatbuffers in languages that differ from the language
that serialized it. For purpose of this tutorial, we assume one language
is used for both serializing and deserializing.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysection*{Application Integration}

The generated files are then included in your project to be built into your application. This is heavily dependent on your build system and language, but generally involves two things\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Importing the generated code.
\item Importing the "{}runtime"{} libraries.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
#include "monster_generated.h" // This was generated by `flatc`
#include "flatbuffers.h" // The runtime library for C++

// Simplifies naming in the following examples.
using namespace MyGame::Sample; // Specified in the schema.
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
using Google.FlatBuffers; // The runtime library for C#
using MyGame.Sample; // The generated files from `flatc`
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 For some languages the runtime libraries are just code files you compile into your application. While other languages provide packaged libraries via their package managers.

!!! note \begin{DoxyVerb}The generated files include APIs for both serializing and deserializing
flatbuffers. So these steps are identical for both the consumer and
producer.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysection*{Serialization}

Once all the files are included into your application, it\textquotesingle{}s time to start serializing some data!

With Flat\+Buffers, serialization can be a bit verbose, since each piece of data must be serialized separately and in a particular order (depth-\/first, pre-\/order traversal). The verbosity allows efficient serialization without heap allocations, at the cost of more complex serialization APIs.

For example, any reference type (e.\+g. {\ttfamily table}, {\ttfamily vector}, {\ttfamily string}) must be serialized before it can be referred to by other structures. So its typical to serialize the data from leaf to root node, as will be shown below.

\doxysubsection*{\doxylink{classFlatBufferBuilder}{Flat\+Buffer\+Builder}}

Most languages use a Builder object for managing the binary array that the data is serialized into. It provides an API for serializing data, as well as keeps track of some internal state. The generated code wraps methods on the Builder object to provide an API tailored to the schema.

First instantiate a Builder (or reuse an existing one) and specify some memory for it. The builder will automatically resize the backing buffer when necessary.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
// Construct a Builder with 1024 byte backing array.
flatbuffers::FlatBufferBuidler builder(1024);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// Construct a Builder with 1024 byte backing array.
FlatBufferBuilder builder = new FlatBufferBuilder(1024);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Once a Builder is available, data can be serialized to it via the Builder APIs and the generated code.

\doxysubsection*{Serializing Data}

In this tutorial, we are building {\ttfamily Monsters} and {\ttfamily Weapons} for a computer game. A {\ttfamily Weapon} is represented by a flatbuffer {\ttfamily table} with some fields. One field is the {\ttfamily name} field, which is type {\ttfamily string}.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ title=\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}monster.fbs"{}}\ linenums=\textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}28"{}}}
\DoxyCodeLine{table\ Weapon\ \{}

\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ damage:short;}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsubsection*{Strings}

Since {\ttfamily string} is a reference type, we first need to serialize it before assigning it to the {\ttfamily name} field of the {\ttfamily Weapon} table. This is done through the Builder {\ttfamily Create\+String} method\+:

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
flatbuffers::Offset<String> weapon_one_name = builder.CreateString("Sword");
flatbuffers::Offset<String> weapon_two_name = builder.CreateString("Axe");
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
Offset<String> weaponOneName = builder.CreateString("Sword");
Offset<String> weaponTwoName = builder.CreateString("Axe");
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 This performs the actual serialization (the string data is copied into the backing array) and returns an offset. Think of the offset as a handle to that reference. It\textquotesingle{}s just a "{}typed"{} numerical offset to where that data resides in the buffer.

\doxysubsubsection*{Tables}

Now that we have some names serialized, we can serialize {\ttfamily Weapons}. Here we will use one of the generated helper functions that was emitted by {\ttfamily flatc}. The {\ttfamily Create\+Weapon} function takes in the Builder object, as well as the offset to the weapon\textquotesingle{}s name and a numerical value for the damage field.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
short weapon_one_damage = 3;
short weapon_two_damage = 5;

// Use the `CreateWeapon()` shortcut to create Weapons with all the fields set.
flatbuffers::Offset<Weapon> sword =
    CreateWeapon(builder, weapon_one_name, weapon_one_damage);
flatbuffers::Offset<Weapon> axe =
    CreateWeapon(builder, weapon_two_name, weapon_two_damage);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
short weaponOneDamage = 3;
short weaponTwoDamage = 5;

// Use the `CreateWeapon()` helper function to create the weapons, since we set every field.
Offset<Weapon> sword =
    Weapon.CreateWeapon(builder, weaponOneName, weaponOneDamage);
Offset<Weapon> axe =
    Weapon.CreateWeapon(builder, weaponTwoName, weaponTwoDamage);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 !!! Tip \begin{DoxyVerb}The generated functions from `flatc`, like `CreateWeapon`, are just composed
of various Builder API methods. So its not required to use the generated
code, but it does make things much simpler and compact.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Just like the {\ttfamily Create\+String} methods, the table serialization functions return an offset to the location of the serialized {\ttfamily Weapon} table.

Now that we have some {\ttfamily Weapons} serialized, we can serialize a {\ttfamily Monster}. Looking at the schema again, this table has a lot more fields of various types. Some of these need to be serialized beforehand, for the same reason we serialized the name string before the weapon table.

!!! note inline end \begin{DoxyVerb}There is no prescribed ordering of which table fields must be serialized
first, you could serialize in any order you want. You can also not serialize
a field to provide a `null` value, this is done by using an 0 offset value.

\DoxyCodeLine{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}


\doxysubsubsection*{Vectors}

The {\ttfamily weapons} field is a {\ttfamily vector} of {\ttfamily Weapon} tables. We already have two {\ttfamily Weapons} serialized, so we just need to serialize a {\ttfamily vector} of those offsets. The Builder provides multiple ways to create {\ttfamily vectors}.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
// Create a std::vector of the offsets we had previous made.
std::vector<flatbuffers::Offset<Weapon>> weapons_vector;
weapons_vector.push_back(sword);
weapons_vector.push_back(axe);

// Then serialize that std::vector into the buffer and again get an Offset
// to that vector. Use `auto` here since the full type is long, and it just
// a "typed" number.
auto weapons = builder.CreateVector(weapons_vector);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// Create an array of the two weapon offsets.
var weaps = new Offset<Weapon>[2];
weaps[0] = sword;
weaps[1] = axe;

// Pass the `weaps` array into the `CreateWeaponsVector()` method to create
// a FlatBuffer vector.
var weapons = Monster.CreateWeaponsVector(builder, weaps);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 While we are at it, let us serialize the other two vector fields\+: the {\ttfamily inventory} field is just a vector of scalars, and the {\ttfamily path} field is a vector of structs (which are scalar data as well). So these vectors can be serialized a bit more directly.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
// Construct an array of two `Vec3` structs.
Vec3 points[] = { Vec3(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f), Vec3(4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f) };

// Serialize it as a vector of structs.
flatbuffers::Offset<flatbuffers::Vector<Vec3>> path =
    builder.CreateVectorOfStructs(points, 2);

// Create a `vector` representing the inventory of the Orc. Each number
// could correspond to an item that can be claimed after he is slain.
unsigned char treasure[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
flatbuffers::Offset<flatbuffers::Vector<unsigned char>> inventory =
    builder.CreateVector(treasure, 10);

```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// Start building a path vector of length 2.
Monster.StartPathVector(fbb, 2);

// Serialize the individual Vec3 structs
Vec3.CreateVec3(builder, 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
Vec3.CreateVec3(builder, 4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f);

// End the vector to get the offset
Offset<Vector<Vec3>> path = fbb.EndVector();

// Create a `vector` representing the inventory of the Orc. Each number
// could correspond to an item that can be claimed after he is slain.
// Note: Since we prepend the bytes, this loop iterates in reverse order.
Monster.StartInventoryVector(builder, 10);
for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--)
{
    builder.AddByte((byte)i);
}
Offset<Vector<byte>> inventory = builder.EndVector();
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysubsubsection*{Unions}

The last non-\/scalar data for the {\ttfamily Monster} table is the {\ttfamily equipped} {\ttfamily union} field. For this case, we will reuse an already serialized {\ttfamily Weapon} (the only type in the union), without needing to reserialize it. Union fields implicitly add a hidden {\ttfamily \+\_\+type} field that stores the type of value stored in the union. When serializing a union, you must explicitly set this type field, along with providing the union value.

We will also serialize the other scalar data at the same time, since we have all the necessary values and Offsets to make a {\ttfamily Monster}.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
// Create the remaining data needed for the Monster.
auto name = builder.CreateString("Orc");

// Create the position struct
auto position = Vec3(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);

// Set his hit points to 300 and his mana to 150.
int hp = 300;
int mana = 150;

// Finally, create the monster using the `CreateMonster` helper function
// to set all fields.
//
// Here we set the union field by using the `.Union()` method of the
// `Offset<Weapon>` axe we already serialized above. We just have to specify
// which type of object we put in the union, and do that with the
// auto-generated `Equipment_Weapon` enum.
flatbuffers::Offset<Monster> orc =
    CreateMonster(builder, &position, mana, hp, name, inventory,
                  Color_Red, weapons, Equipment_Weapon, axe.Union(),
                  path);

```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// Create the remaining data needed for the Monster.
var name = builder.CreateString("Orc");

// Create our monster using `StartMonster()` and `EndMonster()`.
Monster.StartMonster(builder);
Monster.AddPos(builder, Vec3.CreateVec3(builder, 1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f));
Monster.AddHp(builder, (short)300);
Monster.AddName(builder, name);
Monster.AddInventory(builder, inv);
Monster.AddColor(builder, Color.Red);
Monster.AddWeapons(builder, weapons);
// For union fields, we explicitly add the auto-generated enum for the type
// of value stored in the union.
Monster.AddEquippedType(builder, Equipment.Weapon);
// And we just use the `.Value` property of the already serialized axe.
Monster.AddEquipped(builder, axe.Value); // Axe
Monster.AddPath(builder, path);
Offset<Monster> orc = Monster.EndMonster(builder);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 !!! warning \begin{DoxyVerb}When serializing tables, you must fully serialize it before attempting to
serialize another reference type. If you try to serialize in a nested
manner, you will get an assert/exception/panic depending on your language.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysubsection*{Finishing}

At this point, we have serialized a {\ttfamily Monster} we\textquotesingle{}ve named "{}orc"{} to the flatbuffer and have its offset. The {\ttfamily root\+\_\+type} of the schema is also a {\ttfamily Monster}, so we have everything we need to finish the serialization step.

This is done by calling the appropriate {\ttfamily finish} method on the Builder, passing in the orc offset to indicate this {\ttfamily table} is the "{}entry"{} point when deserializing the buffer later.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
// Call `Finish()` to instruct the builder that this monster is complete.
// You could also call `FinishMonsterBuffer(builder, orc);`
builder.Finish(orc);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// Call `Finish()` to instruct the builder that this monster is complete.
// You could also call `Monster.FinishMonsterBuffer(builder, orc);`
builder.Finish(orc.Value);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Once you finish a Builder, you can no longer serialize more data to it.

\doxysubsubsection*{Buffer Access}

The flatbuffer is now ready to be stored somewhere, sent over the network, compressed, or whatever you would like to do with it. You access the raw buffer like so\+:

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
// This must be called after `Finish()`.
uint8_t *buf = builder.GetBufferPointer();

// Returns the size of the buffer that `GetBufferPointer()` points to.
int size = builder.GetSize();
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// This must be called after `Finish()`.
//
// The data in this ByteBuffer does NOT start at 0, but at buf.Position.
// The end of the data is marked by buf.Length, so the size is
// buf.Length - buf.Position.
FlatBuffers.ByteBuffer dataBuffer = builder.DataBuffer;

// Alternatively this copies the above data out of the ByteBuffer for you:
byte[] buf = builder.SizedByteArray();
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Now you can write the bytes to a file or send them over the network. The buffer stays valid until the Builder is cleared or destroyed.

!!! warning "{}\+BINARY Mode"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}Make sure your file mode (or transfer protocol) is set to BINARY, and not
TEXT. If you try to transfer a flatbuffer in TEXT mode, the buffer will be
corrupted and be hard to diagnose.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysection*{Deserialization}

!!! note "{}\+Misnomer"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}Deserialization is a bit of a misnomer, since FlatBuffers doesn't
deserialize the whole buffer when accessed. It just "decodes" the data that
is requested, leaving all the other data untouched. It is up to the
application to decide if the data is copied out or even read in the first
place. However, we continue to use the word `deserialize` to mean accessing
data from a binary flatbuffer.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Now that we have successfully create an orc Flat\+Buffer, the data can be saved, sent over a network, etc. At some point, the buffer will be accessed to obtain the underlying data.

The same application setup used for serialization is needed for deserialization (see application integration).

\doxysubsection*{Root Access}

All access to the data in the flatbuffer must first go through the root object. There is only one root object per flatbuffer. The generated code provides functions to get the root object given the buffer.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
uint8_t *buffer_pointer = /* the data you just read */;

// Get an view to the root object inside the buffer.
Monster monster = GetMonster(buffer_pointer);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
byte[] bytes = /* the data you just read */

// Get an view to the root object inside the buffer.
Monster monster = Monster.GetRootAsMonster(new ByteBuffer(bytes));
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 !!! warning "{}\+BINARY mode"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}Again, make sure you read the bytes in BINARY mode, otherwise the buffer may
be corrupted.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 In most languages, the returned object is just a "{}view"{} of the data with helpful accessors. Data is typically not copied out of the backing buffer. This also means the backing buffer must remain alive for the duration of the views.

\doxysubsection*{Table Access}

If you look in the generated files emitted by {\ttfamily flatc}, you will see it generated , for each {\ttfamily table}, accessors of all its non-\/{\ttfamily deprecated} fields. For example, some of the accessors of the {\ttfamily Monster} root table would look like\+:

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
auto hp = monster->hp();
auto mana = monster->mana();
auto name = monster->name()->c_str();
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
// For C#, unlike most other languages support by FlatBuffers, most values
// (except for vectors and unions) are available as properties instead of
// accessor methods.
var hp = monster.Hp;
var mana = monster.Mana;
var name = monster.Name;
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 These accessors should hold the values {\ttfamily 300}, {\ttfamily 150}, and {\ttfamily "{}\+Orc"{}} respectively.

!!! note "{}\+Default Values"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}The default value of `150` wasn't stored in the `mana` field, but we are
still able to retrieve it. That is because the generated accessors return a
hard-coded default value when it doesn't find the value in the buffer.
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysubsubsection*{Nested Object Access}

Accessing nested objects is very similar, with the nested field pointing to another object type. Be careful, the field could be {\ttfamily null} if not present.

For example, accessing the {\ttfamily pos} {\ttfamily struct}, which is type {\ttfamily Vec3} you would do\+:

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
auto pos = monster->pos();
auto x = pos->x();
auto y = pos->y();
auto z = pos->z();
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
var pos = monster.Pos.Value;
var x = pos.X;
var y = pos.Y;
var z = pos.Z;
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Where {\ttfamily x}, {\ttfamily y}, and {\ttfamily z} will contain {\ttfamily 1.\+0}, {\ttfamily 2.\+0}, and {\ttfamily 3.\+0} respectively.

\doxysubsection*{Vector Access}

Similarly, we can access elements of the {\ttfamily inventory} {\ttfamily vector} by indexing it. You can also iterate over the length of the vector.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
flatbuffers::Vector<unsigned char> inv = monster->inventory();
auto inv_len = inv->size();
auto third_item = inv->Get(2);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
int invLength = monster.InventoryLength;
var thirdItem = monster.Inventory(2);
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 For vectors of tables, you can access the elements like any other vector, except you need to handle the result as a Flat\+Buffer table. Here we iterate over the {\ttfamily weapons} vector that is houses {\ttfamily Weapon} {\ttfamily tables}.

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
flatbuffers::Vector<Weapon> weapons = monster->weapons();
auto weapon_len = weapons->size();
auto second_weapon_name = weapons->Get(1)->name()->str();
auto second_weapon_damage = weapons->Get(1)->damage()
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
int weaponsLength = monster.WeaponsLength;
var secondWeaponName = monster.Weapons(1).Name;
var secondWeaponDamage = monster.Weapons(1).Damage;
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 \doxysubsection*{Union Access}

Lastly , we can access our {\ttfamily equipped} {\ttfamily union} field. Just like when we created the union, we need to get both parts of the union\+: the type and the data.

We can access the type to dynamically cast the data as needed (since the union only stores a Flat\+Buffer {\ttfamily table}).

=== "{}\+C++"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c++
auto union_type = monster.equipped_type();

if (union_type == Equipment_Weapon) {
     // Requires `static_cast` to type `const Weapon*`.
    auto weapon = static_cast<const Weapon*>(monster->equipped());

    auto weapon_name = weapon->name()->str(); // "Axe"
    auto weapon_damage = weapon->damage();    // 5
}
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
 === "{}\+C\#"{} \begin{DoxyVerb}```c#
var unionType = monster.EquippedType;

if (unionType == Equipment.Weapon) {
    var weapon = monster.Equipped<Weapon>().Value;

    var weaponName = weapon.Name;     // "Axe"
    var weaponDamage = weapon.Damage; // 5
}
```
\end{DoxyVerb}
