To generate the docs for Flat\+Buffers from the source files, you will first need to install two programs.


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item You will need to install {\ttfamily doxygen}. See \href{https://doxygen.nl/download.html}{\texttt{ Download Doxygen}}.
\item You will need to install {\ttfamily doxypypy} to format python comments appropriately. Install it from \href{https://github.com/Feneric/doxypypy}{\texttt{ here}}.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

{\itshape Note\+: You will need both {\ttfamily doxygen} and {\ttfamily doxypypy} to be in your \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)}{\texttt{ PATH}} environment variable.}

After you have both of those files installed and in your path, you need to set up the {\ttfamily py\+\_\+filter} to invoke {\ttfamily doxypypy} from {\ttfamily doxygen}.

Follow the steps \href{https://github.com/Feneric/doxypypy\#invoking-doxypypy-from-doxygen}{\texttt{ here}}.

\doxysection*{Generating Docs}

Run the following commands to generate the docs\+:

{\ttfamily cd flatbuffers/docs/source} {\ttfamily doxygen}

The output is placed in {\ttfamily flatbuffers/docs/html}.

{\itshape Note\+: The Go API Reference code must be generated ahead of time. For instructions on how to regenerated this file, please read the comments in {\ttfamily \doxylink{GoApi_8md}{Go\+Api.\+md}}.}
