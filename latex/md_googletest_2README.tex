\doxysubsection*{Announcements}

\doxysubsubsection*{Live at Head}

Google\+Test now follows the \href{https://abseil.io/about/philosophy\#upgrade-support}{\texttt{ Abseil Live at Head philosophy}}. We recommend \href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/blob/master/FAQ.md\#what-is-live-at-head-and-how-do-i-do-it}{\texttt{ updating to the latest commit in the {\ttfamily main} branch as often as possible}}. We do publish occasional semantic versions, tagged with {\ttfamily v\$\{major\}.\$\{minor\}.\$\{patch\}} (e.\+g. {\ttfamily v1.\+15.\+2}).

\doxysubsubsection*{Documentation Updates}

Our documentation is now live on Git\+Hub Pages at \href{https://google.github.io/googletest/}{\texttt{ https\+://google.\+github.\+io/googletest/}}. We recommend browsing the documentation on Git\+Hub Pages rather than directly in the repository.

\doxysubsubsection*{Release 1.\+15.\+2}

\href{https://github.com/google/googletest/releases/tag/v1.15.2}{\texttt{ Release 1.\+15.\+2}} is now available.

The 1.\+15.\+x branch requires at least C++14.

\doxysubsubsection*{Continuous Integration}

We use \doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google}\textquotesingle{}s internal systems for continuous integration.

\doxysubsubsection*{Coming Soon}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item We are planning to take a dependency on \href{https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp}{\texttt{ Abseil}}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Welcome to {\bfseries{Google\+Test}}, \doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google}\textquotesingle{}s C++ test framework!}

This repository is a merger of the formerly separate Google\+Test and Google\+Mock projects. These were so closely related that it makes sense to maintain and release them together.

\doxysubsection*{Getting Started}

See the \href{https://google.github.io/googletest/}{\texttt{ Google\+Test User\textquotesingle{}s Guide}} for documentation. We recommend starting with the \href{https://google.github.io/googletest/primer.html}{\texttt{ Google\+Test Primer}}.

More information about building Google\+Test can be found at \doxysectlink{md_googletest_2README}{googletest/\+README.md}{0}.

\doxysection*{Features}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item x\+Unit test framework\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest is based on the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit}{\texttt{ x\+Unit}} testing framework, a popular architecture for unit testing
\item Test discovery\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest automatically discovers and runs your tests, eliminating the need to manually register your tests
\item Rich set of assertions\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest provides a variety of assertions, such as equality, inequality, exceptions, and more, making it easy to test your code
\item User-\/defined assertions\+: \textbackslash{} You can define your own assertions with Googletest, making it simple to write tests that are specific to your code
\item Death tests\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest supports death tests, which verify that your code exits in a certain way, making it useful for testing error-\/handling code
\item Fatal and non-\/fatal failures\+: \textbackslash{} You can specify whether a test failure should be treated as fatal or non-\/fatal with Googletest, allowing tests to continue running even if a failure occurs
\item Value-\/parameterized tests\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest supports value-\/parameterized tests, which run multiple times with different input values, making it useful for testing functions that take different inputs
\item Type-\/parameterized tests\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest also supports type-\/parameterized tests, which run with different data types, making it useful for testing functions that work with different data types
\item Various options for running tests\+: \textbackslash{} Googletest provides many options for running tests including running individual tests, running tests in a specific order and running tests in parallel
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Supported Platforms}

Google\+Test follows \doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google}\textquotesingle{}s \href{https://opensource.google/documentation/policies/cplusplus-support}{\texttt{ Foundational C++ Support Policy}}. See \href{https://github.com/google/oss-policies-info/blob/main/foundational-cxx-support-matrix.md}{\texttt{ this table}} for a list of currently supported versions of compilers, platforms, and build tools.

\doxysection*{Who Is Using Google\+Test?}

In addition to many internal projects at \doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google}, Google\+Test is also used by the following notable projects\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The \href{https://www.chromium.org/}{\texttt{ Chromium projects}} (behind the Chrome browser and Chrome OS).
\item The \href{https://llvm.org/}{\texttt{ LLVM}} compiler.
\item \href{https://github.com/google/protobuf}{\texttt{ Protocol Buffers}}, \doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google}\textquotesingle{}s data interchange format.
\item The \href{https://opencv.org/}{\texttt{ Open\+CV}} computer vision library.
\end{DoxyItemize}
