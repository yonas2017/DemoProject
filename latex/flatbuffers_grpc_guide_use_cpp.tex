\doxysection*{Before you get started}

Before diving into the Flat\+Buffers g\+RPC usage in C++, you should already be familiar with the following\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Flat\+Buffers as a serialization format
\item \href{http://www.grpc.io/docs/}{\texttt{ g\+RPC}} usage
\end{DoxyItemize}

\doxysection*{Using the Flat\+Buffers g\+RPC C++ library}

NOTE\+: The examples below are also in the {\ttfamily grpc/samples/greeter} directory.

We will illustrate usage with the following schema\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


When we run {\ttfamily flatc}, we pass in the {\ttfamily -\/-\/grpc} option and generage an additional {\ttfamily greeter.\+grpc.\+fb.\+h} and {\ttfamily greeter.\+grpc.\+fb.\+cc}.

Example server code looks like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}


Example client code looks like this\+:


\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}{0}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
