\href{https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flexbuffers.html}{\texttt{ Flexbuffers}} is a schema-\/less binary format developed at \doxylink{namespaceGoogle}{Google}. Flex\+Buffers can be accessed without parsing, copying, or allocation. This is a huge win for efficiency, memory friendly-\/ness, and allows for unique use cases such as mmap-\/ing large amounts of free-\/form data.

Flex\+Buffers\textquotesingle{} design and implementation allows for a very compact encoding, with automatic sizing of containers to their smallest possible representation (8/16/32/64 bits). Many values and offsets can be encoded in just 8 bits.

Flex\+Buffers supports \href{https://serde.rs/}{\texttt{ Serde}} for automatically serializing Rust data structures into its binary format.
