\doxysection*{Running on Linux}

\doxysubsection*{Prerequisites}

To run the tests on a Linux a few prerequisites are needed\+:

1) mono 2) msbuild

\doxysubsection*{Running}

To run the tests\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./NetTest.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will download the .NET installer and core SDK if those are not already installed. Then it will build the tests using {\ttfamily msbuild} and run the resulting test binary with {\ttfamily mono}.

After running the tests, the downloaded .NET installer and SDK are {\itshape not} removed as they can be reused in subsequent invocations. The files are ignored by git by default, and can remain in the working directory.

\doxysubsection*{Cleaning}

If you want to clean up the downloaded .NET installer and SDK, run\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{./clean.sh}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will wipe away the downloaded files and directories. Those will be automatically re-\/downloaded when running {\ttfamily Net\+Test.\+sh}.
